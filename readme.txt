> <strong>Great Plugin</strong> - I highly recommend this plugin. It is easy to use, presents content well and the documentation on WordPress Plugins as well as the developer’s site is excellent and lets the user know how/where to use CSS for customization.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I show my testimonials?  =

* Place the Arconix - Testimonials widget in the desired widget area
* Use the shortcode `[ac-testimonials]` on a post, page or other area
* Place `<?php echo do_shortcode( "[ac-testimonials]" ); ?>` in the desired page template

= Why is the plugin basically unstyled? =

With no 2 themes exactly alike, it's impossible to style a plugin that seamlessly integrates without issue. That's why I made the plugin flexible -- copy `includes/arconix-testimonials.css` to the root of your theme's folder and make your desired modifications. My plugin will automatically load that file instead.

= Is there any other documentation? =

* Visit the plugin's [Wiki Page](https://www.tychesoftwares.com/docs/docs/testimonials/) for all the plugin's documentation

= I have a problem or a bug =

* Check out the WordPress [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/arconix-testimonials/) or the [Issues section on Github](https://github.com/TycheSoftwares/arconix-testimonials)
